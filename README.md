## Welcome To Westpac RooRewards

This is my entry for the Westpac Bank of The Future Hackathon. 

Idea:  The Westpac RooRewards platform offers a gamified savings experience, incorporating interactive games and a GPT-Powered AI persona named Bucky for a fun, hyper-personalized approach to financial management. With features like "RooLotto," where savings translate into lottery tickets, and "Raise Bucky," a game that promotes consistent saving by nurturing a digital pet, the platform aims to incentivize saving through enjoyment and habit formation. Bucky, inspired by the motivational Duolingo mascot, provides AI-driven financial advice, making the process of managing and saving money less daunting and more engaging. By rewarding users with in-app currency called “W coins”, and integrating with Westpac's current reward systems, the app seeks to foster user loyalty and transform saving from a mundane task into a rewarding experience.
